#2. Write a Python program that allows users to log their hiking trips. The program should:
#- Use a while loop to repeatedly ask for a hike name and distance in miles
#- Save each entry to hiking_log.txt (each hike on a new line)
#- When the user presses 0, exit the loop & print the contents of hiking_log.txt

tracker = open("hiking_log.txt", "w")
tracker.write("")
tracker.close

tracker = open("hiking_log.txt", "a")

while True:
    name = input("What's the name of the hiking location? ")
    if name == "0":
        break
    distance = input("How long is the hike? ")
    if distance == "0":
        break
    tracker.write(name + "\t" + distance + "\n")
tracker.close()

tracker = open("hiking_log.txt", "r")
print(tracker.read())
tracker.close()
