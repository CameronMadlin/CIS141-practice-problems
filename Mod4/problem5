#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.
total = int(input("What is your order total? "))
if total >= 50:
    print(f"You are eligible for free shipping, your order total is still ${total}")
else:
    total = total + 5
    print(f"You are not eleigible for free shipping, your order total is now ${total}")
