#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.
user_age = int(input("What is your age? "))
if user_age >= 18:
    print("You are allowed to see R rated movies")
elif user_age >= 13:
    print("You are allowed to see PG-13 rated movies")
else:
    print("You are allowed to see G rated movies")
